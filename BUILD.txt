Missile Command Build Instructions
----------------------------------


Requirements
------------

Missile Command requires Java 5.

Missile Command is built using Maven 2; specifically version 2.0.9.  Therefore, Maven 2 is pre-requisite
of the build and development processes.  Currently, Missile Command has dependencies on log4j and junit, both of
which can be retrieved from standard repositories with no need to modify local settings.xml.


Instructions
------------

1. change to the top level directory (the one containing pom.xml)
2. execute: mvn clean
3. execute: mvn assembly:assembly

This will create a directory called 'target' in which will be created the file
'missile-command-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar'.

To run the game:

1. execute: java -jar target/missile-command-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
